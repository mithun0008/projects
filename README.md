                          ATM MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 
       
       
     This is a unique system that uses c++ program to carry out the 
     simple functions of an ATM machine. initially this system asks
     the user for their input i.e account number, account holder name,
     and their savings balance.It also asks the user for specific amount
     of money to be deposited. it also withdraws the money requested by
     the user.Also the interest percentage of the total sum is credited 
     to the user!. however this system is currently a prototype. provided
     tine and effort along with certain modifications, this system could 
     be brought into a real-time application!!
